# Atta Leafcutter-Ant Image Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify Atta leafcutter-ant images from iNaturalist using machine learning. Our goal is to accurately categorize these ants by gender, status, and role, contributing significantly to ecological studies.

## Supervision and Collaboration
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Fatma Tarlaci

## Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model for the classification of Atta leafcutter-ants.
- Classify ant images into categories: Gender (Male/Female), Status (Alive/Dead), Role (Alate/Dealate).

## Methodology
- Employ and fine-tune a pre-trained model like YOLOv8.
- Document model selection, training processes, and optimization techniques comprehensively.

## Tools and Technologies
- Machine Learning Model: YOLOv8

## Acknowledgements
- Dr. Fatma Tarlaci for her supervision and expertise in machine learning.
- Dr. Ulrich Mueller for initiating this collaborative project and providing the dataset.
